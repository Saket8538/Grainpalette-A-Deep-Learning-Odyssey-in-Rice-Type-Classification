Overview
Rice is a staple food for billions, and accurate classification of its varieties is crucial for quality assurance, research, and trade. Traditional manual classification is time-consuming and error-prone. Grainpalette uses modern deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks, to automate this process. It processes images and physical metrics of rice grains to identify their type, offering consistency, speed, and scalability.

Features
Automated Rice Classification: Classifies rice varieties using image data and physical features.
Deep Learning Models: Utilizes CNNs for high-accuracy image analysis.
Web-Based Interface: Likely provides a frontend for uploading and classifying images.
Configurable & Extensible: Built with JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML, allowing for easy customization and extension.
Tech Stack
Languages: JavaScript (62.8%), HTML (23.2%), TypeScript (14%)
Frontend: Likely HTML and JavaScript-based UI
Styling: TailwindCSS (see tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js)
Build Tools: Vite (see vite.config.ts)
Linting: ESLint (eslint.config.js)
Package Management: npm (package.json, package-lock.json)
Type Checking: TypeScript (tsconfig.json and related files)
Other: The repository may contain zipped datasets or model files
